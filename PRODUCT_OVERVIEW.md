# 🚀 PRODUCT OVERVIEW
**AI Onboarding Engineer**
*Autonomous Interactive Codebase Learning Platform*

## 🔍 Problem Overview
Modern software development relies heavily on large, complex codebases.
However, developers—especially new hires, open‑source contributors, and students—struggle to understand these systems due to:
*   Poor or outdated documentation
*   No structured learning path
*   High dependency on senior engineers
*   Fear of breaking core functionality
*   Steep onboarding time (weeks instead of days)

Existing tools focus on writing code faster, not understanding systems better.
As a result, productivity drops, contributors quit early, and engineering time is wasted.

## 💡 Product Vision
AI Onboarding Engineer is an autonomous, interactive platform that transforms any real-world codebase into a guided learning experience.

Instead of reading documentation or guessing where to start, developers are walked through the codebase step by step, just like onboarding with a senior engineer.

The system focuses on:
*   Learning order
*   System understanding
*   Safe contribution
*   Confidence building

## 🧠 What the Product Does
The platform analyzes a GitHub repository and automatically generates:
1.  A structured learning roadmap
2.  An interactive architecture view
3.  Beginner‑safe, task‑based learning
4.  Context‑aware explanations
5.  Progress tracking toward contribution readiness

This shifts onboarding from passive reading to active learning.

## 🔄 How It Works (High-Level Flow)
1.  **User provides a GitHub repository URL**
2.  **System analyzes** the repository structure, dependencies, and entry points
3.  **A learning graph is created** to model how the system should be learned
4.  **The platform generates**:
    *   Learning steps
    *   Architecture insights
    *   Safe starter tasks
5.  **Developers interact** with the system through:
    *   Visual learning paths
    *   Task completion
    *   Context‑aware AI guidance

## ✨ Key Features
